<h2>Security Project</h2>
The purpose of this project is to become familiar with software that is used to detect  vulnerabilites in
user's accounts, computer operating systems and networks.
<ol>
<li>Choose a software package to install and use to analyze some vulnerabilbity.  A website that
offers free hacking tools is this <a href="http://www.fromdev.com/2014/09/free-hacking-tools-hacker.html">site</a>.
</li><br/>
<li>Decide where the software package will be installed.  Possibilities are on the metis network (ask me for an account), on a home
network or on a laptop (to detect wireless networks.)  Do not choose a network for which you have no
permission to access information or do packet sniffing.
</li>
<br/>
<li>Briefly describe the software  package that you are installing. List your goals for the project, <i>i.e.</i>what you
want to learn or accomplish by
using the software.  Note that some of the packages at the website listed above offer extensive information
and descriptions; others do not.  Hand in this description, the goals and the information from 1) and 2) above by 3/27/2018.
</li><br/>
<li>Install the software on the chosen computer or network and run it.  Obtain output that will allow you to accomplish your goal(s) listed in part
3) above.
</li></br>
<li>Write a report that describes the software, your experience running it and what you learned.  The report is
due 5/9/2018.
