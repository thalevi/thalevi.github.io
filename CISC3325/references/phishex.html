Dear Sir/Madam, 
<p>
I am a private investor based in U.S, Chicago Illinois. A group of government officials from South Africa contacted me with an offer. I am to solicit and state their offer,
 if your Interest is genuine; you can contact me for further briefing. 
</p><p>
I need to engage with you to discuss a high return investment opportunity. You will be made a beneficiary of a very huge sum of money ($120MIL) and it will be transferred 
to you. A high Compensation of 20% awaits you, the remaining balance (minus the interest, handling and tax clearance charges, which will be offset by us and deducted from 
the transfer sum) to a Nominated bank account in Cayman Island or your account. 
</p><p>
I do not think I need to spell out the importance of secrecy in this matter considering what is involved. Let me state clearly here that the account you will be providing 
does not need to have funds in it; it is only needed to be active and can receive the funds in question. 
</p><p>
I need your quick response to this mail to indicate your intent, by getting in touch with me right away. 
</p><p>
This is important as we would need to talk and have a meeting to discuss the modalities of this offer. Let me know your interest if you can come to me or I can come to you 
in Person. For further clarification please contact me through my private telephone number. 
</p><p>
I am here In London now, here are my contact details +447700309005. Or better still my email, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.com
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely,
<br/>
Mr Pat Bodi
