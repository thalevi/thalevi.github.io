<p>Program #1</p>
<p>Using the IR sensor: If the robot is close to an object, have the 
robot stop. But if nothing in it's way (or what was blocking it has 
moved) the robot can go forward. </p>
<p>Try having 2 robots setup with one in behind the other. Start the 
robot in the back and see if it stops when it reaches the 1st robot. 
Start the 2nd robot and see both move together. See what happens if you 
use 3 or more robots.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="https://ev3-help-online.api.education.lego.com/Education/en-us/page.html?Path=blocks/LEGO/Random.html">Random Block</a> and a <a href="https://ev3-help-online.api.education.lego.com/Education/en-us/page.html?Path=blocks/LEGO/CaseSelector.html">Switch</a></p>

  </li>
