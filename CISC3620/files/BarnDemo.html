  Barn Demo

This file has the minimal code to create a working Three.js application,
using the TW object to set up the camera for us. Because the canvas does
not cover the entire window, there is space for some ordinary HTML like
this.


    GUI

The |TW.cameraSetup()| method sets up a THREE.js Orbiting Camera (we'll
learn more about this later) that lets you look at the scene from all
sides. You'll find it's pretty intuitive, but here's a brief listing of
what the mouse will do:

  * Clicking and dragging the mouse on the canvas moves the camera
    around the center of the scene, /orbiting/ it. For example, clicking
    and dragging from left to right lets you look at all the walls of
    the barn, and dragging up and down lets you see the roof and floor.
  * The arrow keys can be used to shift the camera to the left, right,
    up, or down. Dragging the mouse then rotates the barn around a
    different point.
  * The scroll wheel allows you to "dolly" the camera in (closer to the
    center of the scene) or out (farther away). 

Later we'll learn how to modify the GUI to do different actions.


    Keyboard Shortcuts

The |TW.cameraSetup()| method also sets up some keyboard commands. Enter
"?" to find out what they are. You may need to click on the canvas
first, to put it in focus.
